* A Quick Org Export to Impress.js Demo

The contents of the resources directory in this repository were copied from the package install directory of =ox-impress-js=.

A script has been added to impress.org to set random values for the positions and rotations of the slides. Setting these by hand in the HTML is not so much fun.
